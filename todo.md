## Social workout app. Name: FitSpot

- Interactive map where users can highlight their gym/workout area/running track. If enough people highlight them they get "community approved". They can also rate them
- When highlighted for the first time, area can be setup with various parameters: it's type (gym/outdoors/simple pull-up bar/running track) and it's conditions (shady/good view/park/clean etc)
- For each highlighted area a public chat is created. Users can set up / plan their workout time there. User can subscribe to the area to be notified of all the chat messages there
- People can create workout sessions. With specific date and time for specific area. Others can subscribe and join them
- When user registers he have to choose a city or let geolocation guess where he is. Chosen/guessed location gets added to the locations list. Then he gets recommended gyms/workout spaces based on the rating and proximity
- If area is not being used/tracked by anyone, it gets "abandoned". If it's abandoned for a long time, it gets cleaned up from the map
- People can share photos (short videos?) of their workouts in the area. People can like them. Highest liked photos become the highlights of the area
